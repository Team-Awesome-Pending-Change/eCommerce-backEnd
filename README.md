## Authors: Hayden Cooper, Ryan Eastman, Kao Saelor, Reed Vogt, and Reece Renninger.

Project Description: This repo will house the backend portion of our trading card web application.  This will be built using express that connects to multiple APIs as well as a MongoDB for housing unique user information.  This will have security implementations to protect user data through Auth O and allow for CRUD functionalities with building out user decks that are created on the front end.
